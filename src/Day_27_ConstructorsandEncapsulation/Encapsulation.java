     OOP PRINCIPLES : object oriented programing language
•Encapsulation :(Data Hiding)
•Inheritance   :
•Abstraction   :
•Polymorhism   :
OOP  will combine group of realated variables and functıonus to unit (object).

    /*
Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit.
In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.
Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.
To achieve encapsulation in Java −
1.Declare the variables of a class as private.
2.Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values from outside of class.

    ///since all the varibles are priavate which will make them not accessable from outside
    //you will need to assign or modify them
    //there should a way to do this
    //2.Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.
    //this is encapsulation
