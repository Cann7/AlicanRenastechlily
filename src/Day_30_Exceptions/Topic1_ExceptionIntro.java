    Error: An Error indicates a serious problem the application should not try to catch.
Errors are usually beyond the control of the programmer, and we should not try to handle errors. such as infinite recursion, stack overflow errors and so on
Exception: Exception indicates conditions the application should try to catch.

All exception and error types are subclasses of class Throwable,

There are 2 type of Exceptions
1) Built-in Exceptions
2) User-Defined Exceptions

Built-in Exceptions has 2 types
-Checked Exceptions - The reason we called them Checked Exception they are checked at the compile time by the compiler

- Unchecked Exceptions, The compiler will not check those Exceptions during the Compile time. If we do not handle those Exceptions the program will not give Compile Error
to be able to catch exception you need use same level exception or parents of exceptions
for ex : handling arithmetic exceptions will be handled with arithmetic,runtime,exceptions
