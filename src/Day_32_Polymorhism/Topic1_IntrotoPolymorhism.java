    /*
 Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming.
     Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. In other words,
     polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations
2 types of Polymorphism
1) Compile-time Polymorphism
It is also known as static polymorphism.
This type of polymorphism is achieved by  method overloading or operator overloading (Java Does not allow that)
2) Runtime Polymorphism
it is also known as Dynamic Method Dispatch.
 It is a process in which a function call to the overridden method is resolved at Runtime.
 Method Overriding achieves this type of polymorphism
