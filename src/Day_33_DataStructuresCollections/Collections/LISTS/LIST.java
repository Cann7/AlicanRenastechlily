    ////
    ////        ArrayList(C): Internally uses array, singly linked
    ////                Singly linked == retrieving is faster (get)
    ////
    ////        LinkedList(C): each object are doubly linked.
    ////                Doubly linked == removing adding functions are faster
    ////
    ////        Vector(C): array based class, is synchronized  ,only prefer in multi thread
    ////              Synchronized: used for achiving thread-safety

    ////             --extended by Stack(C) : array based class ,is synchorized,last in first out order
    ////        pop(): LIFO, returns the last object from the stack and removes it from stack

    //    //1.List are allowing dublicates objects
    //    //2.order : list will keep the insertion order.
    //    //3null elements : list will allow you to use any number of null elements;
    //    //4.list has dynamic size
