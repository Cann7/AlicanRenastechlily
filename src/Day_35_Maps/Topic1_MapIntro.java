          Maps:

- a mapping between a key and a value.
It is not part of Collection Interface therefore it behaves differently than the other Collection Types.
- a map contains unique keys, No Duplicates are allowed.
- Map is an interface so we can not create an object directly from it.
There are two interfaces for implementing Map in java. T
they are Map and SortedMap, and three classes: HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap

Where can we use it:

for instance mapping the zip codes for the cities:
mapping each manager to list of employees,
map each student with list of classes or vice versa,
